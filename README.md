# summer-chores

This project demonstrates **asynchronous JavaScript** using three different approaches:
1. **Callback functions**
2. **Promises**
3. **Async/Await**

It simulates a person completing summer chores every Saturday, with a chance of falling asleep as they become tired.

The purpose of this assignment is to practice different ways of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
