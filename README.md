# summer-chores

This project demonstrates **asynchronous JavaScript** using both **callback functions** and **Promises**.
It simulates a person completing summer chores every Saturday, with a chance of falling asleep as they become tired.

The purpose of this assignment is to practice callback chaining, promise chaining, and proper project documentation.
