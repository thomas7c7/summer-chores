# summer-chores

This project demonstrates the use of **JavaScript callbacks** to perform asynchronous tasks in a strict sequence.  
It simulates a person completing summer chores every Saturday, with a chance of falling asleep as they become tired.

The project is designed to practice callback functions and understand callback chaining.
